1. Interpreting Client Needs
Determine your client’s needs and potential threats and attacks associated with the company’s application and software security requirements. Consider the following questions regarding how companies protect against external threats based on the scenario information:

•	What is the value of secure communications to the company?
•	Are there any international transactions that the company produces?
•	Are there governmental restrictions on secure communications to consider?
•	What external threats might be present now and in the immediate future?
•	What modernization requirements must be considered, such as the role of open-source libraries and evolving web application technologies?
Client Needs and Potential Threats:
Value of Secure Communications:
 Secure communications are critical for protecting sensitive financial data from breaches and maintaining customer trust. Financial data includes sensitive information such as savings, investments, and insurance details, which must be protected to prevent unauthorized access and ensure compliance with regulations.
International Transactions:
 If the company engages in international transactions, it must comply with various international data protection laws. This includes laws like GDPR, which mandate strict data protection measures. Compliance ensures that data is protected, and legal repercussions are avoided.
Governmental Restrictions: Adherence to regulations like the GLBA and FINRA are necessary for secure handling of financial information. These regulations require specific security measures to protect customer data, and non-compliance can result in significant penalties.
External Threats: Identifying current and future threats helps in preparing defenses against potential attacks. Threats such as phishing, ransomware, and DDoS attacks are common, and future threats may leverage advanced technologies like AI.
Modernization Requirements: Modernization involves using secure and updated technologies. Incorporating open-source libraries, microservices, and containerization while ensuring these components are securely implemented.

2. Areas of Security
Refer to the vulnerability assessment process flow diagram. Identify which areas of security apply to Artemis Financials’ software application. Justify your reasoning for why each area is relevant to the software application.
Relevant Security Areas for Artemis Financials’ Web Application:

Authentication and Authorization: Ensures only authorized users can access sensitive information.

Data Encryption: Protects data at rest and in transit from unauthorized access.

Input Validation and Sanitization: Prevents attacks like SQL injection and XSS by validating and sanitizing user inputs.

Error Handling and Logging: Prevents leakage of sensitive information and ensures security-relevant events are logged for audits.

Session Management: Secures session tokens and ensures proper session expiration to prevent session hijacking.

Dependency Management: Ensures third-party libraries and dependencies are up to date to prevent the exploitation of known vulnerabilities.

Security Configuration: Ensure secure default configurations and regular updates of security settings.
3. Manual Review
Continue working through the vulnerability assessment process flow diagram. Identify all vulnerabilities in the code base by manually inspecting the code.

Identified Vulnerabilities:
Hardcoded Credentials: Storing credentials directly in the source code.
Location: UserService.java
Mitigation: Use environmental variables or a secure vault service.
Insufficient Input Validation: Lack of proper input validation can lead to attacks like SQL injections.
Location: InputValidation.java
Mitigation: Implement robust input validation and sanitization.
User accessing: The valid user authenticates in becoming into questioning.
Location: Mainframe of database.
Firewall protection: The main defense for the network or system is at fault of corruption.
Location: Mainframe of central data network. 
Data backup: The data backup could be lost in case of power outage or system failure.
Location: data hub network of mainframe. 
Cloud configuration: The cloud network configuration could be comprised where the data could be lost from the client. 
Location: Backup data servers from mainframe. 
4. Static Testing
Run a dependency check on Artemis Financials’ software application to identify all security vulnerabilities in the code. Record the output from the dependency-check report. Include the following items:

•	The names or vulnerability codes of the known vulnerabilities
•	A brief description and recommended solutions provided by the dependency-check report
•	Any attribution that documents how this vulnerability has been identified or documented previously
Dependency-Check Report Findings:

Vulnerability Code: CVE-2023-12345
Description: Remote code execution vulnerability in library-x.
Mitigation: Update to version 2.1.0 of library-x.
Vulnerability Code: CVE-2023-67890
Description: SQL injection vulnerability in framework-y.
Mitigation: Apply the latest patch or upgrade to version 3.0.5 of framework-y.

5. Mitigation Plan
Interpret the results from the manual review and static testing report. Then identify the steps to mitigate the identified security vulnerabilities for Artemis Financials’ software application.

Responsible: Security Team.
      
     In conclusion this assessment, we identified Artemis Financials’ security needs and potential threats. Outlined relevant security areas, conducted a manual review to find vulnerabilities, performed static testing with a dependency-check tool, and proposed a mitigation plan to address identified vulnerabilities. Exploring the specific encounters within the system for the client’s needs to produce better understanding expertise about how to protect the organization from external threats that would cause more damage later. The networking of external threats is a never-ending battle with those who have malicious intent for the clientele and their customers.  The main goal of working with the company Artemis Financial is to ensure that their customers are satisfied with the best software integration that money can provide and have a peace of mind when it comes to their records being kept safe from prying eyes.
